abstract = {Localization is one of the important requirements in wireless sensor networks for tracking and analyzing the sensed data/events. In most of the applications of wireless sensor networks, the event information without its location information has no significance. The well known traditional Distance-Vector Hop (DV Hop) algorithm and weighted centroid DV Hop based algorithms can be easily implemented in real wireless sensor networks with low cost and no additional hardware requirement, but it has poor localization accuracy and high power consumption. In order to avoid these limitations, a weighted centroid DV-Hop algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm uses weights that consider the influence of different factors such as number of anchors, communication radius, and nearest anchor to determine location of unknown node. Simulation results and theoretical analysis prove that proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional DV-Hop algorithm in terms of localization error and power consumption.}

abstract = {Localization has attracted a lot of research effort in the last decade due to the explosion of location based service (LBS). In particular, wireless fingerprinting localization has received much attention due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing hardware. In this work, we take a closer look at the underlying aspects of wireless fingerprinting localization. First, we review the various methods to create a radiomap. In particular, we look at the traditional fingerprinting method which is based purely on measurements, the parametric pathloss regression model and the non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Then, based on these three methods and measurements from a real world deployment, the various aspects such as the density of access points (APs) and impact of an outdated signature map which affect the performance of fingerprinting localization are examined. At the end of the paper, the audiences should have a better understanding of what to expect from fingerprinting localization in a real world deployment.}

abstract = {Radio systems capable of localization have emerging applications in homeland security, law enforcement, emergency response, defense command and control, multi-robot coordination and vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-pedestrian collision avoidance. In fact, high resolution localization is vital for many applications, including: traffic alert, emergency services, e.g., indoor localization for firefighters, and battlefield command and control. These systems promise to dramatically reduce society's vulnerabilities to catastrophic events and improve its quality of of life.While work this important area is progressing, limited resources are available to support graduate students and researchers in this important area. Specifically, a limited number of books has been published in this area covering selected subjects. This comprehensive handbook offers gaps of available localization books presenting in-depth coverage from fundamentals of coordinates to advanced application examples.}
