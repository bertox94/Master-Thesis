abstract = {Localization is one of the important requirements in wireless sensor networks for tracking and analyzing the sensed data/events. In most of the applications of wireless sensor networks, the event information without its location information has no significance. The well known traditional Distance-Vector Hop (DV Hop) algorithm and weighted centroid DV Hop based algorithms can be easily implemented in real wireless sensor networks with low cost and no additional hardware requirement, but it has poor localization accuracy and high power consumption. In order to avoid these limitations, a weighted centroid DV-Hop algorithm is proposed in this paper. The proposed algorithm uses weights that consider the influence of different factors such as number of anchors, communication radius, and nearest anchor to determine location of unknown node. Simulation results and theoretical analysis prove that proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional DV-Hop algorithm in terms of localization error and power consumption.}

abstract = {Localization has attracted a lot of research effort in the last decade due to the explosion of location based service (LBS). In particular, wireless fingerprinting localization has received much attention due to its simplicity and compatibility with existing hardware. In this work, we take a closer look at the underlying aspects of wireless fingerprinting localization. First, we review the various methods to create a radiomap. In particular, we look at the traditional fingerprinting method which is based purely on measurements, the parametric pathloss regression model and the non-parametric Gaussian Process (GP) regression model. Then, based on these three methods and measurements from a real world deployment, the various aspects such as the density of access points (APs) and impact of an outdated signature map which affect the performance of fingerprinting localization are examined. At the end of the paper, the audiences should have a better understanding of what to expect from fingerprinting localization in a real world deployment.}

abstract="We now begin several applications of the theory developed in the last two chapters. In the present chapter we consider first the geometry of the solution sets of quadratic equations in n variables. These solution sets generalize ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas in two variables, and a classification of their geometry in n dimensions is given by the inertia of the coefficient matrix of the quadratic form. In the next section we treat the unconstrained quadratic optimization problem and show that a necessary and sufficient condition for a unique solution is that the coefficient matrix be definite. We then consider the special constrained optimization problem of a quadratic function on the unit sphere and show that the maximum and minimum are just the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix. This leads to the famous min-max representation of the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix. In Section 4.3 we specialize the minimization problem to the very important least squares problem and give the basic result on the existence and uniqueness of a solution. Particular examples are the linear regression and polynomial approximation problems. Then we treat the least squares problem in a more general way and obtain a minimum norm solution in the case that the original problem has infinitely many solutions. We show that this minimum norm solution can be represented in terms of a generalized inverse based on the singular value decomposition.",
